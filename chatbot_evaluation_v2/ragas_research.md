# RAGAS Framework Research

## Overview

RAGAS (Retrieval Augmented Generation Assessment) is a framework designed to evaluate the performance of RAG-based systems. It provides a set of metrics that can be used to measure different aspects of RAG system performance, helping in component selection, error diagnosis, and continuous monitoring.

## Key Metrics for RAG Evaluation

### Context Precision
- Measures the proportion of relevant chunks in the retrieved contexts
- Calculated as the ratio of relevant chunks to total chunks
- Can be implemented with or without reference contexts
- LLM-based implementation uses an LLM to determine relevance
- Non-LLM implementation uses string matching and other techniques

### Context Recall
- Measures how well the retrieved contexts cover the information needed to answer the question
- Evaluates if important information is missing from retrieved contexts

### Context Entities Recall
- Focuses specifically on the recall of named entities in the context
- Useful for fact-based questions where entity information is critical

### Faithfulness
- Measures if the generated answer is faithful to the provided context
- Identifies hallucinations or fabricated information
- Critical for ensuring trustworthiness of RAG systems

### Response Relevancy
- Evaluates if the generated response is relevant to the question
- Helps identify off-topic or evasive answers

### Noise Sensitivity
- Measures how sensitive the system is to noise in the context
- Important for robustness evaluation

## LLM vs Non-LLM Evaluation Methods

RAGAS provides both LLM-based and non-LLM based implementations for several metrics:

### LLM-based methods:
- Use another LLM to evaluate the quality of responses
- Can provide more nuanced evaluation
- Examples: LLMContextPrecisionWithReference, LLMContextPrecisionWithoutReference

### Non-LLM methods:
- Use algorithmic approaches without requiring an LLM
- Generally faster and less expensive
- Examples: NonLLMContextPrecisionWithReference, NonLLMContextRecall

## SQL-Specific Metrics

RAGAS also includes metrics specifically for text-to-SQL applications:
- LLMSQLEquivalence: Evaluates if generated SQL queries are equivalent

## Applications to Chatbot Evaluation

For a comprehensive chatbot evaluation system, we can use RAGAS metrics to evaluate:
1. Retrieval quality (Context Precision, Context Recall)
2. Response quality (Faithfulness, Response Relevancy)
3. Robustness (Noise Sensitivity)

These metrics can be combined with custom LLM critique approaches to provide a more comprehensive evaluation framework.
